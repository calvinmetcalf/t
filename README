Putting MBTA subways into osm
#todo
-finish creating the relations, we'll need
blue line:2 (east and west)
orange line:2 (north and south)
red line:6 (north and south for both ashmount and braintree, plus both ways for the mattapan line)
green line:8 (east and west for all 4 lines, it should be remembered that they don't all start at the same point)
-get the stations into the relations
-get subways enterences in (currently trying to see if the MBTA has them, if they do I can probably get them)
-make sure platforms and above ground buildings are tagged
-figure out a tagging scheme we can all agree on.
-buses?
